        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">Avast, ye landlubber! Before ye embark on this grand adventure, we need to go over some guidelines. But fear not, we'll make this as delightful as finding buried treasure!</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">Arr! By treading these digital waters, ye be agreeing to our terms. If ye'd rather be watching kitten videos, we understand. Meow! 😸</p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">When ye create an account, guard yer password like ye would yer precious loot. Sharing passwords be as foul as sharing a toothbrush. Ew!</p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">We be fond of yer tales, but let's keep 'em shipshape, mateys. No offensive, harmful, or illegal content. Picture yer dear old grandma peeking over yer shoulder.</p>

          <li><strong>Respect Others:</strong> Play nice. Treat others as ye would like to be treated. Arrr, matey!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">All ye post be yer own, but ye grant us the right to show it off. Think of it as us proudly displaying yer artwork on our cabin walls. 🖼️</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">5. Termination</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">We hope it never comes to this, but we can make ye walk the plank and terminate yer account if ye break the code. It's akin to being cast overboard from the most splendid pirate ship ever. 😢</p>
